# Stepper-motor-with-IR-remote
The code helps an IR remote control the stepper motor. It uses an IRremote library and stepper library.
The code is specifically used to control the clockwise and anti-clockwise rotation of the stepper motor in a novel gripper for its grasp ans release action. Find more about the gripper at Idaho State University Robotics Lab website.
